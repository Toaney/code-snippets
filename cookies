// Create Cookies

Create a Cookie with JavaScript
JavaScript can create, read, and delete cookies with the document.cookie property.

With JavaScript, a cookie can be created like this:

document.cookie = "username=John Doe";
You can also add an expiry date (in UTC time). By default, the cookie is deleted when the browser is closed:

document.cookie = "username=John Doe; expires=Thu, 18 Dec 2013 12:00:00 UTC";
With a path parameter, you can tell the browser what path the cookie belongs to. By default, the cookie belongs to the current page.

document.cookie = "username=John Doe; expires=Thu, 18 Dec 2013 12:00:00 UTC; path=/";


// Read Cookies

Read a Cookie with JavaScript
With JavaScript, cookies can be read like this:

var x = document.cookie;
document.cookie will return all cookies in one string much like: cookie1=value; cookie2=value; cookie3=value;


// Change a Cookie with JavaScript
With JavaScript, you can change a cookie the same way as you create it:

document.cookie = "username=John Smith; expires=Thu, 18 Dec 2013 12:00:00 UTC; path=/";
The old cookie is overwritten.



// Delete a Cookie with JavaScript
Deleting a cookie is very simple.

You don't have to specify a cookie value when you delete a cookie.

Just set the expires parameter to a passed date:

document.cookie = "username=; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 UTC; path=/;";
You should define the cookie path to ensure that you delete the right cookie.

Some browsers will not let you delete a cookie if you don't specify the path.
